# What is Apigee Edge
Apigee Edge is the Google Cloud API Management product.
Apigee is a platform for developing and managing API proxies. Main purpose of Apigee Edge is to expose backend REST services as APIs by being a proxy (a facade) to receive requests from API consumers (clients).
Apigee Edge provides value-added features like security, rate limiting, quotas, analytics, and more. The primary consumers of Edge API proxies are app developers who want to use your backend services.

# API Proxy
The API proxy isolates the app developer from your backend service. Therefore you are free to change the service implementation as long as the public API remains consistent. By creating an API proxy you let Edge handle the security and authorization tasks required to protect your services, as well as to analyze, monitor, and monetize those services.

Out of the box Apigee Edge can auto-generate API Proxy code from a file formatted according to the OpenAPI specification (Swagger). Apigee Edge also has an OpenAPI specification editor & store used to maintain OpenAPI specifications.

Because app developers make HTTP requests to an API proxy, rather than directly to your services, developers do not need to know anything about the implementation of your services. All the developer needs to know is:

* The URL of the API proxy endpoint.
* Any query parameters, headers, or body parameters passed in a request.
* Any required authentication and authorization credentials.
* The format of the response, including the response data format, such as XML or JSON.

* Postman tool ( for testing API â€˜s), or else curl command commandline Linux/OSX
* Editor, Intellij, Atom, VScode ( support XSL/XML, javascript, java, json, yaml)
* Exposed backend API (or use the internal Apigee Mock Service)
* Preferred a Git/Github Repo (to save your created Apigee config work) or save it locally

# Setup your own Apigee integration

* Create an API and API Specification (Swagger 2.0 & 3.0 are supported)
* Run and expose your API
* Test your backend API
* Create or upload your created Spec file in Apigee
* Create a simple API Proxy based on your Spec file
* Create an API proxy to secure the API with an app-key
* Generate API Product and Developer Account
* Create APP
* Test your API through Apigee
* Add rate limit to your API for traffic management purpose
* API Diagnostics with Trace tool
